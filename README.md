# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) User Interface

## Overview

This project implements a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** user interface for managing users, roles, and permissions. The purpose of the system is to allow administrators to assign roles, define permissions, and manage user access efficiently. The application is designed to be secure, user-friendly, and flexible for different use cases.

### Features

- **User Management**: View, add, edit, delete, and assign roles to users.
- **Role Management**: Create, edit, and delete roles with configurable permissions.
- **Dynamic Permissions**: Assign and modify permissions for roles dynamically.
- **API Simulation**: Simulate API calls to handle CRUD operations for users and roles.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **CSS**: Custom styling
- **State Management**: React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- **API Simulation**: Mocked API for CRUD operations on users and roles
